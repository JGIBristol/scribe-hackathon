The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces significant transboundary One Health threats, where human, animal, and environmental health are deeply interconnected.

Factors such as conflict, climate change, rapid urbanization, and large-scale displacement create ideal conditions for the emergence and spread of diseases including zoonotic infections, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and other biosecurity risks.

Weak cross-border surveillance and fragmented data-sharing mechanisms hinder timely responses, increasing the risk of outbreaks escalating into regional or global crises.
